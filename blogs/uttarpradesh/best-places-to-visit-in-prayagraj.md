Triveni Sangam, in Allahabad, is where the holy Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers meet. This place is deeply revered in Hinduism. The city is often called Sangam because of its connection to this sacred confluence. Every 12 years, it hosts the grand Kumbh Mela, and every six years, the Ardh Kumbh. During these festivals, millions take a dip to cleanse their souls.

The Ganga and Yamuna rivers meet at the Sangam, each with its own distinct color. This natural wonder symbolizes the rich spirituality of the region. A visit to Triveni Sangam is a journey into the heart of Hindu tradition, where faith, culture, and nature harmoniously merge.

You can make your visit even more special by taking a boat ride. You have two choices. You can book a whole boat for about 600 rupees. This way, you get the boat all to yourself and your group. Or, if you're traveling on a budget, you can share a boat with others for just about 60 rupees per person. You'll also get to watch the religious ceremonies happening on the riverbanks. It's a unique experience that mixes nature, culture, and spirituality.

Kushro Bagh is a fascinating place for history enthusiasts, situated near prayagraj railway station. This park gets its name from Prince Khusro, the eldest son of Mughal Emperor Jahangir. The reason it's so famous is because it's where they held him captive due to differences in beliefs with his father. He tried to escape but sadly, his own brother, who later became Emperor Shah Jahan, ordered his death.

The park itself is quite lovely, with a beautiful garden and three impressive sandstone mausoleums. One of these is for Prince Khusro, and the other two are for his wife and sister. These mausoleums show off the stunning Mughal architecture.
